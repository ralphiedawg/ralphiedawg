## Hi 👋

I'm Ralph, someone trying to learn software development.
I do very random projects, just trying to get the basics down

## Flipper Zero
I use my flipper zero a lot, it's a lot of fun to learn and use with.
I also own a M5Stickc Plus, simply for fun.

##My Work
Currently, my only documented and published work is the brainrot generator, however, I'd like to make a habit of publishing my projects on here.
